jsx is a javascript extension. it alllows us to put html inside the javascript code. 
jsx has some rules.

we cannot use "class" attribute. so we have used the className.

we cannot use the "for" attribute that we use in <label> tag. we have to use "htmlFor" instead of it.  

we can not use that html tags without "/" which are single tags like <input type="text">, <br>, <hr>
we have to use slash with them like <input type="text" />, <br/>, <hr/>

we can return only a single parent element inside the return. like 

return{
    <div "first parent">

    </div>

    <div "second parent">
    // this second parent element is not allowed in jsx.
    </div>

    we can wrap both of the above tags inside a dive to remove error.
}

react is just like a synthetic sugar if we have to write is syntax manually it will be verry difficult.

like if we want to write following lines in react manually
this is in jsx file.
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>The App Component!</h1>
      </div>
    );


than we have to write then in such a way;

this is with out jsx in javascript
  return React.createElement(
      'div', //element created
      { className: 'App' }, // class name 
      React.createElement('h1', null, 'The App Component') //inside element is created.
    );
