now we'll deal with states and deal with embedding components with other components.

lets i have a contacts component. in which i want to have a state which holds all the different contacts basically an object that has different contacts with the name, email, and phone number.
an inside that contact component i'll loop through the people or contacts in that state and then output a specific contact module or module component for each one.

now create a new file Contacts.js. it will have a class based components which actually have a state.
.

constructor is not need if only want to make a state. its used if we want to instantiate an object.
