for knowing about the useReducer we have to know all about the reducer() method of javascript

what is useReducer?
useReducer is a hook for state management
useReducer is alternative to useState. 
whats the difference betwee nthe two?
>> useState is infact built using useReducer
so useReducer is more premitive hook compare to useState.

here is a most important question
when to use useReducer vs useState?
we'll get its answer after going through some examples.

for now we have to know that useReducer is a hook for state management.

the major point is that we dont have to know about redux to know all about useReducer.

-------------------------------------------------------------

we have some built in javascript functions for array
forEach, map, reduce.

we have to know more about reduce function.
the reduce() method executes a reducer() function (that we provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.


const array1 =[1,2,3,4]
const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer))
 // expected o/p is 10,

console.log(array1.reduce(reducer, 5))
// expected o/p is 15;


two important points
1- reduce() function tale two parameters.
2- first parameter is a reducer() function and the second parameter is the initial value that the reducer function can make use of.

there is a huge similarity between reduce and useReducer hook.

>> reduce is javascript, and useReducer in react.
>>>> syntax for reducer is 
    array.reduce(reducer , initialValue)
>>>> syntax for useReducer is
    useReducer(reducer, initialState)

>> in case of reducer
    singleValue = reducer(accumulator, itemValue)
>> in case of useReducer
    newState = reducer(currentState , action)
    action is an object with two values action.type and action.payload

>> reduce method returns a single value 

>> useReducer returns a pair of values.
    [newState, dispatch] 
    dispatch is a method which is basically used to specify the action.

Summary

>> useReducer is a hook that is used for state management in React.
>> useReducer is related to reducer functions
>> useReducer(reducer, initialState)
>> reducer(currentState , action)
>> useReducer is used to chang the states in react component.
