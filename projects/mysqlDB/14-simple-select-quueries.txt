we want to change the data type of price in store>product 
its initially VARCHAR
we'll convert it to decimal.

first launch the MySQL Workbench,
select the "store" database by typing, then run the following command.


>> ALTER TABLE products MODIFY price decimal;

then check in phpmyadmin, the unit has been changed.

we can also use letters in lower case 
>> alter table products modify price decimal;

how to select data from a table ??

syntax:
>> SELECT field_name1,field_name2  FROM database ;
>> SELECT field_name1,field_name2  FROM tablename;

if we want to select everything from the table, than use following.
>> SELECT *  FROM database/tablename 

>> SELECT first_name from customers;
>> SELECT name from products;

select more than one things

>> SELECT name,price,category from products;

----------------------------------------------------------

select with condition
 
>> SELECT city from customer_address where id=3;


selection criteria may be changed 
-----
>> SELECT email from customers where first_name = "fname-4";
-----------
>> SELECT description from products where price = 99;
>> SELECT description from products where price >= 99;
>> SELECT description from products where price <= 99;
>> SELECT description from products where price >= 200;


---------

>> SELECT * from products where  name like 'tablet%';


-------------

select every name starts with "s"
>> SELECT * from products where  name like 's%';

's%'  its means search the word starts with s 
'%s'  its means search the word ends with s 
'%s%' its means select the exact word s.

the last one is very helpfull. what the user enter is a variable and take it between the percentage signs and after hitting search show the result to user,

Conditional select. 
using (this and/or that)
logic gates.
 


>> SELECT * from products where  category = 5 && price < 80;
here &&===AND 
||===OR 



Ordering the output according to name.
>> SELECT * from products where  category = 5 || category = 1 AND price < 80 order by name;
order in reverse order
>> SELECT * from products where  category = 5 || category = 1 AND price < 80 order by name DESC;
here default is ASC=ascending.



order by category 
>> SELECT * from products where  category = 5 || category = 1 AND price < 80 order by category;
in reverse order 


to limit the output to some extent.
>> SELECT * from products where  category = 5 || category = 1 AND price < 80 order by category desc limit 1,3;

start from 1 and take next 3 numbers.
if 2,3
then start from 2 and select next 3.
