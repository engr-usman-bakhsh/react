for updating and deleting a file we have to check it with dual checks. like we may put a condition on a value to check its name as well as its foreign. this dual check will help us to exactly target on the item which we want.

syntax to update an item.

>>UPDATE products SET name = "our Required Name"  WHERE id=3;

before "WHERE" the thing is which we want to do. and after the "WHERE" there is a condition bt which we'll select the targetted element.

>> UPDATE products SET name = "Red Apple" WHERE id =3 AND category = 2 and name = "apple"
 i applied three conditions for error free output.

 how to update more than one fields at a time?

 >> update customers set first_name='anas',last_name='ameen',email='anas@gmail.com' where id=5

 Delete something.

 syntax
 >> DELETE FROM table-name WHERE condition;

 >> DELETE FROM `customer_address` WHERE CUSTOMER=16
