alia is actually a short temporarily name. if a table has a name and we have to write the long querry than we use the alias.
for example
let the first name is f and last name is l and so on.   
syntax:

>>SELECT first_name AS "First Name", last_name AS "Last Name" FROM customers;
these are column aliases,

empty space between the name requires a double quotes around the name.

how to make table aliases?





combine selection and aliases of tables and columns 
here i am selecting the product whose name is android.
>> SELECT p.name AS "Product Name", pc.name AS "Product Category",p.price AS "Product Price"
FROM products AS p, product_categories AS pc
WHERE p.name = "android" AND p.id=pc.id


here i am selecting all the products with their specific name , category and price 

>> SELECT p.name AS "Product Name", pc.name AS "Product Category",p.price AS "Product Price"
FROM products AS p, product_categories AS pc
WHERE p.id=pc.id



ordered products 
>> SELECT p.name AS "Product Name", pc.name AS "Product Category",p.price AS "Product Price"
FROM products AS p, product_categories AS pc
WHERE p.id=pc.id
ORDER BY pc.name
